          <dt>1. What are the major classical dance forms of India?</dt>
          <dd>
            India has several classical dance forms, each with its unique style,
            music, and cultural significance. The major ones are:
            <ul>
              <li>Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu)</li>
              <li>Kathak (Uttar Pradesh)</li>
              <li>Kathakali (Kerala)</li>
              <li>Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh)</li>
              <li>Manipuri (Manipur)</li>
              <li>Mohiniyattam (Kerala)</li>
              <li>Odissi (Odisha)</li>
              <li>Sattriya (Assam)</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>

            2. What is the significance of mudras in Indian classical dance?
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Mudras are symbolic hand gestures used in classical dance to convey
            emotions, stories, or themes. They play a crucial role in
            Bharatanatyam, Kathak, and other classical styles. Each mudra has
            its own meaning, such as representing nature, deities, or specific
            actions.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>3. How is music involved in traditional Indian dance?</dt>
          <dd>
            Music plays a vital role in Indian dance forms, providing rhythm and
            mood. Classical Indian dance is usually accompanied by live music,
            which can include traditional instruments like the tabla, mridangam,
            sitar, veena, flute, and vocals. The music often follows specific
            ragas (melodies) and talas (rhythmic cycles), which match the
            dancer’s movements and expressions.
